# What I learned
 - Create ulta low operations code to run efficiently on a low compute resource system.
 - Finite State Machine design for coninuously running code
 - Button debouncing optimization
   - Example code I was given used too many looping operations and was too slow. I optimized the code by batching my input read operations and my arethmetic operations.
